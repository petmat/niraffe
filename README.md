# niraffe
Just a proof of concept about if we could have a similar framework for TypeScript as Giraffe is for F#.

## The idea

I've been looking for alternatives to the current Node.js frameworks (express, NestJS, etc.) with a more functional twist. 
I have some experience in the F# land so I decided to give it a go and see if I can make something similar to what they have done with Giraffe.

No intention to rip off other people's hard work. Just to see if it works and then maybe build something new from there.
